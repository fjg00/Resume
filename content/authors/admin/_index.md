After completing my bachelor of engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the American University of Beirut, I am excited to pursue my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus in Systems and Control at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Professors [Margaret P. Chapman]([url](https://www.control.utoronto.ca/~mchapman/)) and [Mireille Broucke]([url](https://www.control.utoronto.ca/~broucke/)). Throughout my time at AUB, I have worked on several worthwhile projects. I have also had the pleasant opporotunity to join the Adaptive Systmes Lab at EPFL, Switzerland as a research intern in Summer 2022, under the direct supervision of PhD candidate[Mr. Mert Kayaalp]([url](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mert-Kayaalp)) and [Professor Ali Sayed]([url](https://asl.epfl.ch/biography/)). The work which led to the journal paper titled "Policy Evaluation in Decentralized POMDPs with Belief Sharing" which was published in IEEE OJCSYS.

My research interests include reinforcement learning, optimization, control, and multi-agent systems.
