I am a senior Electrical & Computer engineering student at the American University of Beirut (AUB). My main research interests are around autonomous robotics, machine learning, computer vision, and reinforcement learning.

I have just concluded my 2-month summer internship at the Adaptive Systems Lab at EPFL where I worked on a project in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning within Partially Observable Environments. I am currently working on my final year project is on "Human-Machine Interaction and Shared control for Autonomous Vehicles” whereby my team and I aim to enhance the experience of the driver and improve control handover between the vehicle itself and the driver. 
  
Some relevant courses I have taken: Introduction to Machine Learning, Numerical Linear Algebra, Instrumentation, Embedded and IoT Systems, System Analysis & Design (Graduate Course), System Identification (Graduate Course), and Reconfigurable Computing.
