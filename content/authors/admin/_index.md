After completing my bachelor of engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the American University of Beirut, I am thrilled to pursue my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus in Systems and Control at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Professors [**Margaret P. Chapman**]([url](https://www.control.utoronto.ca/~mchapman/)) and [**Mireille Broucke**]([url](https://www.control.utoronto.ca/~broucke/)). 

Throughout my time at AUB, I have worked on several worthwhile projects. I have also had the pleasant opportunity to join the Adaptive Systmes Lab at EPFL, Switzerland as a research intern during Summer 2022, under the direct supervision of PhD candidate [**Mr. Mert Kayaalp**]([url](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mert-Kayaalp)) and [**Professor Ali Sayed**]([url](https://asl.epfl.ch/biography/)). Our work together resulted in a journal paper titled "Policy Evaluation in Decentralized POMDPs with Belief Sharing," which was published in IEEE OJCSYS.

My research interests encompass a diverse range of areas, including reinforcement learning, optimization, control, and multi-agent systems. Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my research, projects, and publications. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and look forward to collaborating with fellow researchers and scholars in pursuit of innovative solutions to complex engineering challenges.
