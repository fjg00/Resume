Absolutely thrilled to have received the LEBNet Scholarship Award for the year 2023, an award intended for senior Lebanese engineering students from different Lebanese universities planning to pursue their graduate studies in the U.S. or Canada.  The LebNet scholarship is a testament to their unwavering support and belief in my potential, and it has given me the motivation and drive to continue striving for excellence in my studies and future endeavors.

I am deeply grateful for this opportunity, and I am committed to making the most of it by working diligently and contributing positively to the LebNet community.
In addition to the scholarship award, I will also be teamed up with a LebNet mentor from the Early in Career community who would be willing to provide guidance and support throughout my academic journey.
