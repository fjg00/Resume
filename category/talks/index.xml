We presented our final year project findings to faculty and students, and were one of the few teams that were nominated for the &amp;ldquo;Creative Achievement Award&amp;rdquo;. It was an excellent networking opportunity that allowed us to showcase the value of our project.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
