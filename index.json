Chapman and Mireille Broucke.\nThroughout my time at AUB, I have worked on several worthwhile projects. I have also had the pleasant opportunity to join the Adaptive Systmes Lab at EPFL, Switzerland as a research intern during Summer 2022, under the direct supervision of PhD candidate Mr. Mert Kayaalp and Professor Ali Sayed. Our work together resulted in a journal paper titled “Policy Evaluation in Decentralized POMDPs with Belief Sharing,” which was published in IEEE OJCSYS.\nMy research interests encompass a diverse range of areas, including reinforcement learning, optimization, control, and multi-agent systems. Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my research, projects, and publications. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and look forward to collaborating with fellow researchers and scholars in pursuit of innovative solutions to complex engineering challenges.\nDownload my resume.\n","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1688169600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"After completing my bachelor of engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the American University of Beirut, I am thrilled to pursue my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus in Systems and Control at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Professors Margaret P.","tags":null,"title":"Fatima Ghadieh","type":"authors"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

The experience was truly incredible and surpassed all my expectations. Not only did I have the chance to work on a high-caliber project, but I also had the opportunity to explore and travel throughout Switzerland, immersing myself in the rich culture and diverse languages of the country.\nEPFL’s faculty and staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming, creating a supportive and collaborative environment. The work-life balance at EPFL was impressive, allowing me to make the most of my time both inside and outside the lab. I had the privilege of visiting numerous breathtaking locations such as Zermatt, Gruyeres, Zurich, Bern, Noiraigue, Lugano, Bellinzona, Nyon, and even the renowned CERN in Geneva.\nThroughout my internship, I was fortunate to work alongside my mentor and advisor, Mr. Kayaalp. His mentorship was truly admirable, and I consider myself lucky to have been one of his first students in his PhD journey. Together, we achieved great results, culminating in the publication of a journal paper. This accomplishment has been a testament to the dedication and guidance provided by Mr. Kayaalp.\nThe EPFL campus itself is nothing short of amazing. Surrounded by the majestic Alps, the combination of the stunning natural beauty and the presence of world-class faculty inspires the mind and fuels creativity. Every day on campus was a source of motivation and excitement.\nOverall, my summer at the Adaptive Systems lab at EPFL has been a transformative experience. I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to work on cutting-edge research, explore Switzerland’s beauty, and forge lifelong friendships. It is an experience that will undoubtedly shape my academic and personal journey for years to come.\n","date":1663027200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663027200,"objectID":"b20fcf9d808ca310210afec9cbb6ba39","permalink":"https://fjg00.github.io/post/asl_epfl2022/","publishdate":"2022-09-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/asl_epfl2022/","section":"post","summary":"Summer 2022 at the Adaptive Systems lab, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Excellence in Engineering Fellowship at EPFL, Switzerland","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Driver safety is a major concern for the automotive industry today, and researchers and industries are exploring the introduction of self-driving vehicles as a solution. These vehicles aim to assist drivers during their journeys, making them more enjoyable, safe, and efficient. Despite the introduction of new features to self-driving vehicles, many people still do not trust them enough and prefer to be in control of the driving experience. This lack of trust can be attributed to various factors, such as the lack of information about automated vehicles, poor communication with the automation, or people being unaware of the full capabilities of the system.\nTo address this issue, we propose a human-machine interface (HMI) that facilitates the process of hand-back and takeover between the driver and the vehicle. Our HMI leverages inputs from the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus of the car to predict the driver’s intentions accurately and display them in a safe and user-friendly manner. We evaluated several predictions, such as identifying whether the driver is stuck in traffic or attempting to parallel-park. As our project involves the safety of drivers and passengers, we must comply with several standards and constraints. Our system must make accurate predictions in real-time while running on a local device, adhering to various standards set by associations such as SAE, NHTSA, and ITU.\nWe used the CARLA (Car Learning to Act) Simulator to simulate real-world traffic scenarios and parallel parking situations, collecting data such as throttle, brake, speed, steering wheel angle, and reverse signals for analysis. This analysis enabled us to develop and test various machine learning models, ultimately choosing the models with the highest accuracy.
